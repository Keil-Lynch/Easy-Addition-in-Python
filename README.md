Easy Addition in Python

Description

An = sign can be used directly to assign variables to an + operator

Problem Solution

1. As input, provide three variables; x, y, & n
2. Define an operator with the + symbol
3. Assign the variables with integers linked directly to an equal sign
4. Define the function (print) to generate output. 

Program Explanation

1. First variable x will equal integer 30
2. The second variable y will equal integer 180
3. The third variable n will equal variables x(integer) + y(integer)
4. The equation n = x + y
5. print n
6. Exit the program

Test Case Study (Run Program)

User input(micro code equation to automatically generate as output)

Micro code:

x = 30;
y = 180;
n = x+y;
print(n);

User output: 210
